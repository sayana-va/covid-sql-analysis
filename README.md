# COVID Data Analytics Project (SQL)

## Overview
This project demonstrates **descriptive and inferential data analysis** on COVID-19 data using SQL.  
The SQL script (`covid_data.sql`) includes:
1. Data cleaning and handling missing values
2. Descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, median, mode)
3. Dispersion measures (variance, standard deviation, percentiles)
4. Correlations between confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases
5. Ranking and row numbering
6. Linear regression (slope and intercept) for simple predictions

> The SQL file is fully commented, so you can read and understand it **without running a database**.
